This project is incomplete and it was developed during the weekend of 23/11/2014 after having problem due to invalid chars within subtitles of a film.

The purpose was to provide a GUI to edit subtitles with `srt` and `sub` format and fix them when needed.
Currently, the only developed feature is to interpret `srt` format which is the simplest.

It was written with Java 8, but it still works with Java 17.

## Install

```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

Execute the following main classes:
- `Test01` to read `srt` and `sub` files
- `Test01` to interpret the `srt` file and open a draft frame
